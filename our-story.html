          <p style="margin-top:12px;">
            Originally from the Massachusetts suburbs, Jackson grew up working alongside his father on projects around the home. 
            From installing backyard patios to remodeling bathrooms, he learned early on the value of craftsmanship, attention to detail, 
            and doing things the right way.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:12px;">
            In 2023, Jackson began working in the landscaping industry professionally, quickly earning a promotion to foreman where he 
            supervised both hardscape and softscape projects. Today, he takes pride in delivering high-quality work while fostering a safe, 
            respectful, and enjoyable environment for his team. His hands-on experience and leadership ensure every project is completed with 
            care, precision, and long-term durability.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:12px;">
            Alongside his professional experience, Jackson is currently pursuing a Bachelors degree at Loyola University 
            Chicago. His academic background strengthens his approach to project planning, problem-solving, and efficiency. By 
            combining hands-on trade experience with analytical thinking, Jackson brings a detail-oriented and organized mindset to 
            every project.

          <h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:8px;">Anton</h2>
          <p style="margin-top:12px;">
            Anton comes from a farm family background that instilled a strong work ethic and respect for hands-on craftsmanship 
            from an early age. Growing up splitting time between Minneapolis, Minnesota and the family farm, he developed practical 
            skills through outdoor labor, woodworking, and painting. This upbringing built a foundation of reliability, attention to 
            detail, and pride in quality work, which are values that continue to guide his approach to every project. 
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:12px;">
            With over four years of hands-on landscaping experience, Anton brings both technical skill and leadership to the field. 
            He has managed crews, coordinated projects from start to finish, and ensured high standards across residential and 
            commercial properties. His background working on the farm translates directly into efficient execution, problem-solving 
            on the job site, and a commitment to getting work done right the first time.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:12px;">
            In addition to his field experience, Anton is currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Business at Loyola University 
            Chicago, where he is building a strong foundation in operations, management, and strategic planning. He also brings 
            horticultural expertise from his time at Bailey Nurseries, one of the country's largest plant nurseries, where he gained 
            hands-on experience with plant care, inventory, and large-scale plant propagation operations. By combining practical 
            landscaping knowledge with formal business training, he helps lead a company that is both quality-driven and built for 
            long-term success.
